# Real Time Face Detection and Recognition .
In this project this software can detect and Recognize a Human Face in Real Time. 

The overall process is an 3 step process.

1. Data collection that means take image using camera.You can see the code here datasetCreator.py  

2. Train the recognizer that trains the overall images.You can see the code here trainner.py

3. Face detection that detect a face whose data available on dataset , if whose data not available then detector tells Unknown . You can see the code here detector.py
